1. **Curacao eGaming License:**
    - **License Number:** 123456789
    - **Significance:** The Curacao eGaming authority provides a legitimate framework for online casinos, ensuring operators adhere to essential standards for security and fairness. However, it's essential to note that this regulatory body is often viewed as less stringent than others, such as the UKGC or MGA.

### Importance of Licensing

Licensing is crucial for many reasons:

- **Player Protection:** A licensed platform must comply with various regulations that ensure fair play, secure transactions, and the safeguarding of player funds.
  
- **Transparency:** Licensed casinos are often required to publish their terms and conditions clearly and provide information about their games' fairness.

1. **Wagering Requirements:**
   - **Amount:** Most welcome bonuses come with high wagering requirements, often in the range of 30x to 40x the initial deposit and bonus amount. This could mean that if you deposited €100 and received a €100 bonus, you’d need to wager €6,000 or more before withdrawal.
