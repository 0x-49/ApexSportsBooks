PointsBet was founded in 2015 by a team of sports betting enthusiasts in Australia who were determined to innovate the way betting was perceived and how it could engage both casual fans and serious gamblers. Their mission was to create a platform that presented betting as entertainment rather than just a means to win money.

**Early Years:**

In its early days, PointsBet faced the challenge of establishing itself amid the traditional sports betting giants. It focused on building a robust infrastructure that could handle the innovative points betting model it pioneered. Securing a strong partnership with global sporting events and leagues added credibility to its brand and attracted initial users.

**Expansion and Innovation:**
