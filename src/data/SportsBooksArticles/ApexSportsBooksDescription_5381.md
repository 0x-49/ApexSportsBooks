### Licensing Information

When it comes to online gambling, security and regulatory compliance are paramount.

This license guarantees that the platform adheres to strict standards of operation to protect players.

## III. Accepts UK Players? What You Need to Know

### Legal Framework for UK Players

The UK has a robust regulatory framework for online gambling, principally governed by the **UK Gambling Commission (UKGC)**. Quigioco.it operates under Italian regulations and, at this time, does not hold a UKGC license, which raises the question about its acceptance of UK players.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Current Status:** Players from the UK can register and play on Quigioco.it but should be mindful of the regulatory implications of playing on a site without a UKGC license.
- **Legal Protection:** Since it operates under Italian law, UK players may not benefit from the same protections as with a UK-licensed site.

### What This Means for UK Players

While there are no clear restrictions preventing UK players from utilizing Quigioco.it, potential players need to weigh the benefits against possible risks:

- **Withdrawal of Protections:** Should any disputes arise, players are subject to ADM regulations instead of those provided by the UKGC.
- **Payment Method Limitations:** Certain payment options may be restricted for users based in the UK due to European regulations.
- **Currency Support:** Quigioco.it primarily operates in Euros, which could involve conversion fees for UK players transacting in GBP.
