## III. Licensing and Regulatory Compliance: Why It Matters

### Licensing Information

Understanding the legal standing of an online betting platform is crucial for ensuring a safe betting environment. Kwikbet operates under licenses obtained from the Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB) in Kenya, which is responsible for regulating gambling in the country.

The BCLB license signifies that Kwikbet is subject to stringent oversight, which includes:
