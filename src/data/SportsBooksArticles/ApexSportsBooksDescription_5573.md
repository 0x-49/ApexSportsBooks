### How to Maximize Your Bonus

- **Slot Focus:** If you choose to take advantage of the bonus, stick primarily to slots to maximize your contribution towards wagering.
- **Thoroughly Review Terms:** Players should always take the time to read through the promotional terms carefully to avoid unexpected pitfalls.
