## III. Licenses and Fines: Understanding the Regulatory Landscape

### Licensing Information

Operating in the online gambling space comes with significant regulatory oversight, and BetRivers.net takes compliance seriously. The platform holds licenses from several reputable authorities, ensuring that it operates under stringent industry standards.

**Key Regulatory Authorities:**

1. **Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB):**
