## III. Licenses and Fines: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape

Holding a license from a reputable body like the Estonian Tax and Customs Board means that Olybet is committed to player protection. This includes providing:

- **Fair Gaming:** Regular audits to ensure the fairness of games and betting outcomes.

Being licensed also means that Olybet must maintain a level of transparency concerning its operations. This involves:
