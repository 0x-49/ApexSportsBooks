## III. Licenses and Fines: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape

### Licensing Information

While providing sports predictions, one important aspect to consider is the regulatory framework within which a platform operates. As of now, Forebet.com does not operate as a gambling site but rather as a statistics and prediction platform.

### Potential Risks

- **Data Integrity:** Users must assess the reliability of the statistics and predictions provided, as Forebet does not have regulatory oversight in terms of sports betting integrity.
- **Advisory Nature:** Forebet acts in an advisory capacity; thus, users should approach betting with caution and verify insights through multiple sources before making decisions.

### Can It Be Trusted?

As an analytical site, the emphasis on licensing is less critical than the accuracy and transparency that Forebet maintains while providing its insights. For additional confidence, users should take note of public feedback and reviews on the website’s predictive models.
