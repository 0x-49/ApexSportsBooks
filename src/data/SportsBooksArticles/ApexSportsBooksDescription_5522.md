## III. Licenses and Fines: Navigating Regulatory Compliance

### Regulatory Licenses

Operating within the online gambling space requires adherence to strict regulations from governing bodies. BetParx operates under licenses that ensure compliance with industry standards.

**Licensing Authorities:**
