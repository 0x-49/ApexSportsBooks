1. **Northern Territory Racing Commission (NTRC):**
   - **License Number:** 803.
   - **Significance:** The NTRC ensures that licensed sportsbooks maintain high standards of fairness and security while also promoting responsible gambling practices. This license signifies a commitment to ethical operations, player protection, and overall integrity in the gaming industry.

**Importance of Licensing**

- **Player Protection:** Licensed sites are held accountable for maintaining a fair and secure gaming environment, meaning that player funds are protected and that games are regulated for fairness.
