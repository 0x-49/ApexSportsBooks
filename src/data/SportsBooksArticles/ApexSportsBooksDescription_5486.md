## IV. Accepts UK Players? What You Need to Know

### Legal Framework for UK Players

In the UK, online gambling is strictly regulated by the **UK Gambling Commission (UKGC)**. Notably, as of now, Scommettendo.it primarily targets Italian players, and does not hold a UKGC license. Therefore, it does not officially accept UK players.

### Implications for UK Players

**Exclusivity in Services:**

Players from the UK may find themselves unable to access certain features, bonuses, and promotions offered exclusively to Italian residents. Therefore, UK bettors may look to alternative platforms with UKGC licensing for a fully compliant experience.

### Players Outside Italy

For those outside of the UK, particularly within jurisdictions where Scommettendo.it operates legally, the platform provides an engaging and tailored experience catering to a wide range of bettors.
