## IV. Accepts UK Players? What You Need to Know

### Legal Framework for UK Players

Though iFortuna primarily operates in Slovakia, the question of whether it accepts UK players is essential for those residing there. UK players must note that online betting sites should possess a license from the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) to legally accept UK bettors.

**iFortuna's Position:**

- **UK Players:** As of the latest information, iFortuna does not hold a UKGC license, meaning UK players might face restrictions when attempting to access the site.
  
### Options for UK Players

- **Currency Support:** The platform generally operates in Euros, which may lead to currency conversion fees for UK players.
- **Localized Payment Options:** UK players may not find familiar payment methods, such as PayPal, readily available.

### Responsible Gambling for UK Players

For players committed to responsible gambling, iFortuna emphasizes its adherence to responsible gambling guidelines; however, UK players should verify if these measures align with UK standards.

### Conclusion for UK Players

While iFortuna provides an exciting platform with numerous offerings, UK residents should exercise caution and do extensive research due to the lack of a UKGC license.
