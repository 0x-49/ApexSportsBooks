## III. Licenses and Fines: Understanding Regulatory Compliance

### Licensing Information

Operating as an online casino requires stringent adherence to laws and regulations set by governing authorities. Coins.Game operates under licenses from reputable authorities, ensuring players can trust the platform.

1. **Curacao Gaming License:**
   - **License Number:** Available upon request from the casino.
   - **Significance:** Curacao is one of the more lenient jurisdictions, allowing online operators to offer games without the strict regulations of other regions. However, it demands that operators uphold standards concerning fair play, data protection, and transparency.

### Importance of Licensing

**Player Protection:**
- **Fair Gaming:** Regular verification of games to ensure fairness and proper randomization.
- **Secure Transactions:** Ensures that all transactions remain confidential and secure.

### Conclusion on Licensing

Players should always exercise caution and perform their own due diligence when engaging in online gambling.
