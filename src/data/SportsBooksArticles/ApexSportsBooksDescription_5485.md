## III. Licenses and Fines: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape

### Licensing Information

Regulatory compliance is a cornerstone of any credible online betting platform. Rabona is licensed under the Curacao eGaming authority, a jurisdiction known for its relatively lenient regulations compared to others like the UK or Malta. This license allows Rabona to operate in several markets, extending its reach to players across many countries.

**Significant Aspects of Licensing:**

1. **Curacao eGaming License:**
   - **License Number:** Not typically displayed publicly, as Curacao maintains less transparency than other jurisdictions.
   - **Regulatory Environment:** While it does not have as rigorous standards as the UK Gambling Commission or the Malta Gaming Authority, being licensed signifies that Rabona complies with basic operating standards.

### Importance of Licensing

**Player Protection:**

- Rabona must adhere to the guidelines of its licensing authority, ensuring that players' funds and personal information are safeguarded.
- Players have some level of recourse if issues arise, although the process may not be as robust as in more regulated markets.

### Compliance and Fines

As of October 2023, Rabona has maintained a clean operational record with no public fines or disciplinary action against it. This suggests that it is handling its operations effectively and adhering to its licensing requirements.
