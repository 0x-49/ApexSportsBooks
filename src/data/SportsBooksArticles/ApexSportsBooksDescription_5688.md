## IV. Accepting UK Players? What You Need to Know

**Currency Support:**
- Transactions ideally should support British Pounds (GBP) to avoid additional conversion fees.

**Customer Support:**
- Ababet must ensure that its customer service team is knowledgeable about UK-related affairs and issues to cater to UK players adequately.

**Bonuses and Promotions:**
- UK players should be wary of terms surrounding bonuses as they may not have the same protections as players on UKGC-licensed sites. 

### Responsible Gambling Initiatives

**Self-Exclusion Options:**
- Access to self-exclusion measures is critical for players who may need them.

**Access to Support Organizations:**
