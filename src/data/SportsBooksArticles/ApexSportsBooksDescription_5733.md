## III. Licenses and Fines: Understanding Dolfwin's Regulatory Compliance

### Licensing Information

**Licenses Held:**

Dolfwin.com operates under licenses from well-respected authorities, ensuring a level of credibility and safety for players:

1. **Curacao eGaming License:**
   - **License Number:** Available upon request.
   - **Significance:** Curacao is known as a favorable licensing jurisdiction for gambling operators, but it's worth noting that it doesn't enforce stringent regulations like some others. While offering some level of player protection, players should remain vigilant.

   - **Future Plans:** Dolfwin has indicated intentions to apply for licenses from more stringent jurisdictions like the UK Gambling Commission and the Malta Gaming Authority to enhance player trust.

### What Does Licensing Mean for You?

**Player Protection:**
- Although Curacao does provide a form of regulatory oversight, it's essential to understand its limitations. Players can generally expect:

  - **Secure Transactions:** Licensed operators are required to implement encryption technologies.
  - **Dispute Resolution:** Players have access to appropriate channels in case of disagreements.

### Regulatory Compliance and Fines

**Track Record:**
- With Dolfwin being a newer platform, it hasn’t yet encountered substantial controversies or fines, indicating its focus on compliance early in its operation.

**Potential Risks:**
- While having a Curacao license offers some legitimacy, the absence of heavier regulation highlights the need for players to exercise caution and conduct their own research.
